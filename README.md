The PCB was designed in [KiCAD](http://kicad-pcb.org/) and manufactured by [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/). It's essentially a giant shield for an Arduino Mega that drives many Power MOSFET devices, and conditions the inputs from the car. It also has many connectors for illuminated pushbuttons.

Many through-hole components were used for ease of assembly, and overall design simplicity.

The following diagram describes how signals are moved through the system:
